# CloudUploader S3 File Upload Tool

The purpose of this project is to create a bash-based CLI tool that allows users to quickly upload files to a specified cloud storage solution, providing a seamless upload experience similar to popular storage services.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- AWS subscription S3 bucket
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) has been installed and configured for each user requiring the upload functionality
- Assumed basic knowledge of Linux (file creation & permissions management)


## Usage

The tool is used as following

./uploadtos3.sh <Path to the local file you want to upload> <Destination path in the S3 bucket>

Examples: ./uploadtos3.sh ./example.txt uploads/

Please note that the script will prompt you to enter your S3 Bucket name.

Additional functionality has now been added. The user will now get a shareable link that will expire in one hour.
